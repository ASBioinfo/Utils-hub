About lunchtime.

All these scripts were made for this paper:
A beginners guide to estimating the non-synonymous to synonymous rate ratio of all protein-coding genes in a genome.

We have tested them all with our data sets, and we hope they are useful to you.
But we do not gaurantee they will work with your data.
See the DISCLAIMER in each script.

Feel free to use them, hack them, or share them.


################################################
THE SCRIPTS WE HAVE NOW ARE:
################################################

multiple_sequence_splitter.pl
Splits a FASTA file with many sequences into one file per sequence

gff_cds_proteins_processor.pl
Extracts CDS sequences from a FASTA nucleotide file according to GFF coordinates, translates

genes_from_genome.pl
Extracts CDS sequences and proteins from a Genbank or Embl file

align_orthologs.pl
Aligns proteins, generates codon-aware nucleotide alignment
* This has not been rigorously checked, and need some work.


################################################
THE SCRIPTS WE HAVE YET TO DO ARE:
################################################

orthologs_from_RBBH.pl
Assigns orthologs using the clustered Reciprocal Best Blast (cRBB) approach

concatenate_alignments.pl
Takes a list of alignment files and outputs a single concatenated alignment file

codeml_simple.pl
Runs CODEML for all genes in a list

codeml_site_models.pl
Runs CODEML for all genes in a list. Performs the likelihood ratio tests for site models

codeml_branch_models.pl
Runs CODEML for all genes in a list. Performs the likelihood ratio tests for branch models.
