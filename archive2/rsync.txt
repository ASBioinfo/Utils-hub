he command varies if you are pushing or pulling or using the daemon, but the options remain the same.

rsync -rtu --delete SOURCE root@x.x.x.x:/DESTINATION

In this example, pay attention to the -rtu --delete options.
 We have already discussed the -r and -t options–recursive copy and time stamp copy. 
The -u option tells rsync to update only different/changed/added files from the SOURCE to the DESTINATION. 
The option --delete will remove any files from the DESTINATION that the SOURCE may no longer have. 
With this (and other options, like -l for symlinks) you can keep directories in multiple locations up to date with the source.


when first time transferring the file:

rsync -rt SOURCE root@x.x.x.x:/DESTINATION

to update the destination we need to run :

rsync -rtu SOURCE root@x.x.x.x:/DESTINATIONs
