### Objective: In this exercise is to learn genomics data management for processing and analysis

# I: Navigation and exploration of folders
### 1. To Print the name of current/working directory : pwd <br>
```
$pwd 

Whenever you want to know, where are you OR when you lost on unix  terminal, use pwd command.
```

### 2. To list content of folder : ls
```
Syntax
ls [-l], [-lh] [<directory_to_list>]

-l: Listing of files and folders
-h: Human readable format
-a: Do not ignore entries starting with '.' i.e hidden files
-r: Reverse order while sorting
-R: List sub-directories recursively
-s: Print the allocated size of each file, in block
-S: Sort by file size, largest first
-t: Sort by modification time, newest first (to see last updated files)

File permissions, ownership, size and date of creation, you can add the -l flag to the command.
Use wild-card to list file and folder starting with same alphabet. 

$ ls 

$ ls -lh

````

### 3. Make directory: mkdir
```
Syntax
mkdir <folder_name>
       -m: Set folder mode (as in chmod), not a=rwx - umask
       -p: Make parent directories as needed
       -v: Explain what is being done (Print a message for each created directory)

mkdir simply creates a new empty folder.

$mkdir –p my_directory
$mkdir –pv my_directory
$mkdir -m a=r+w my_directory  (To give read and write permission to folder )
```

### 4. Change directory: cd
```
Syntax
cd <target_directory>

Examples
$ pwd
/ home / reaper
$ cd Documents
$ pwd
/ home / reaper / Documents
```

### 5. Create a file: nano
```
Command usage: nano <file_name>
1. nano My_nanofile.txt
2. write something “This is testing of nano text editor"
3. <Control> + o (To save the file )
4. Enter
5. <Control> + x (Exit the file )
```

# II: Text reading and redirection of text file	 
### 1. Display file content: cat/less/more
```
cat filename
less filename
more filename
```

### 2.To see top content of file : head
```
syntax
head [option] file_name
Option
-n : to show the specified number of lines
-c : to show the specified number of bytes
-v : to show the file name tag
-q : to don't separate the content of multiple files with a file name tag

Examples
head filename
head -n filename

```
### 3.To see bottom content of file :tail

```
syntax
tail [option] file_name
Option
-n : to show the specified number of lines
-c : to show the specified number of bytes
-v : to show the file name tag
-q : to don't separate the content of multiple files with a file name tag

Examples
tail filename
tail -n filename
```

# III: Copying and Removing Files	

### 1. Copy files and directories

```
Syntax
Command usage: cp [-i] <target_file> <end_location>
options:
    -i: Prompt before overwrite 
    -f: If an existing destination file, remove it and try again
    -u, Update copy only when the source file is newer than the destination file or when the destination file is missing
    -t: Copy all source arguments into directory 
    -r: Copy directories recursively
    -n: Do not overwrite an existing file (overrides a previous -i option)

Examples
$cp -i xaa_file Sandeep/
cp: overwrite 'Sandeep/xaa'?  (if file exist)
$cp xaa_file Sandeep/
```
 


### 2. Move/rename file : Used for two different purposes: Move a file to a different location/Rename a filename

```
Syntax
Command usage: mv (-i) <target_file> <end_location>
options:
     -i: Prompt before overwrite 
     -f: Pf an existing destination file, remove it and try again
     -u: Update copy only when the source file is newer than the destination file or when the destination file is missing
     -r: Copy directories recursively
     -n: Do not overwrite an existing file 

One useful flag argument when moving, copying or removing files is the -i (interactive) flag. If this flag is used, you will be asked if you want to remove files before they are permanently erase.

Examples
$ mv -i File.txt my_directory/File_renamed.txt
mv : overwrite ’ Docs /File_renamed.txt ’?
# You can reply to this by typing ’y ’ (YES) or ’n ’ (NO) , and then return
$ mv File1.txt my_directory/File1_renamed_file.txt
# Note : No warning here  and file will be overwritten if exist. 

```


### 3. Remove directory and files:rm (-f/-i/-r/-v)
```
Syntax
rm [OPTION]... [FILE]...
    -f: Delete files forcefully, ignore nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt
    -i: Prompt before every removal
    -r: Remove directories and their contents recursively
    -d: Remove empty directories
    -v: Explain what is being done

Examples
$ rm –irv my_directory
$ rm –irvf my_directory
$ rm –irvf file_name

```

# IV. File Streaming
```
File streams: Standard input (stdin): Used to read file content into a program.
echo " Adding a line " > a_short_file . txt
echo " Adding another line " >> a_short_file . txt

Standard output (stdout): Used to output content from the program.
$ echo " More text ! " > for_later_usage . txt   ## save in first/different file
$ echo " More text ! " >> for_later_usage . txt  ## save in same file

Standard error (stderr): Similar to stdout, but commonly used to separate error messages from regular program output.
large_program > stdout_example.txt 2> stderr_example.txt

```
# V. Navigation of files and folders 

### Directories
```
Present working directories: pwd
Special directories:
Root directory (/): highest directory in system
Home directory(~): home directory of user
Current directory(.): where you are
Parent directory (..): one directory before current directory

```

### Path
```
Absolute path: i.e start from root/home directories
Relative path: i.e. start from current/parent directories
```

# VI: Compress and decompress

```
Zip
Gzip [c,-k]
tar [-czvf] compressed_file_name Source_file_name
bzip2

```
